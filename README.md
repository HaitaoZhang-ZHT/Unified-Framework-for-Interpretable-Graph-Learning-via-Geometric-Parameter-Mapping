1.The RFMs for Cora and Pubmed are both run in the same environment.

MHWNN and the Cora dataset are run in the same environment.

The HWNN and Res-HWNN for Pubmed are run in the same environment.

Each has its corresponding requirements.


2.If the initialization method is adopted, it is imperative to set the filter of HWNN and Res-HWNN to be consistent with the dimension of data features (1433 for Cora; 500 for Pubmed; 260 for Esol after encoding).
